### Branch
<p>Without content or file branching is not effective. That means you have to have file and commited. Then the branching will work. The default branch name for local git-scm is <b>master</b>. But If you want to push your master branch data into <b>GitHub</b> then you need to change local branch name as main.

<p>You can also rename GitHub branch name. For that you need to go setting option of the current repo. Then there have branch section, where the branch name can be editable. But remember there should have one deafult branch, which by default the first one (if you the change the branch name though). If you changed branch name then Github will instruct or guide you how you can change your local env for continuous push pull.

1. <code>git branch</code> : is a git branch command which check how many branch have in the current directory & currently which branches you have in.

2. <code>git branch {branch name}</code> : is a git branch command which will create a branch in the current director

3. <code>git branch -m {branch name}</code> : is a git branch command which will merge existing current branch name to your provided name. -m means mearge.

4. <code>git checkout {branch name}</code> : is a git branch command which will change branch and will move into provided branch name if it created and exit.

5. <code>git branch -d {branch name}</code> or <code>git branch --delete {branch name}</code> : is a git branch command which will delete branch but can not delete current branch name. You can use <code>-d</code> or <code>--delete</code> as your wish.

6. <code>git switch {branch name}</code> : is a git branch command which is use for switch or move from one branch to another. In locally every branch can be have separate project. By switching you can move or switch from one branch to another by this command.

7. <code>git push origin HEAD</code> : Is a git push command if you create a new branch but do not have Remote (origin) exist yet. This command will push and create a branch as same as local name. 


### Remote Branch
1. <code>git config --get remote.origin.url</code> : Show remote repository URL.

2. <code>git remote show origin</code> : Show remote repo branches. 

3. <code>git branch -vv</code> : Show upstream branches.

5. <code>git branch -v</code> : show branch and recent commit.

4. <code>git push origin HEAD</code> : Use to push to the branch of the same name on the remote.

5. <code>git clone --single-branch -b {branch name} {remote link}</code> : Use to clone single specific branch from remote repo.
